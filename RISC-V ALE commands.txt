RISC-V ALE commands:
write-stdin string
    Writes a string to the stdin (file descritor = 0)
SweRV Commands:
The argument hart=<id> may be used with any command.
help [<command>]
  Print help for given command or for all commands if no command given.
run
  Run till interrupted.
until <address>
  Run until address or interrupted.
step [<n>]
  Execute n instructions (1 if n is missing).
peek <res> <addr>
  Print value of resource res (one of r, f, c, m) and address addr.
  For memory (m) up to 2 addresses may be provided to define a range
  of memory locations to be printed.
  examples: peek r x1   peek c mtval   peek m 0x4096
peek pc
  Print value of the program counter.
peek all
  Print value of all non-memory resources
poke res addr value
  Set value of resource res (one of r, c or m) and address addr
  Examples: poke r x1 0xff  poke c 0x4096 0xabcd
disass opcode <code> <code> ...
  Disassemble opcodes. Example: disass opcode 0x3b 0x8082
disass function <name>
  Disassemble function with given name. Example: disas func main
disass <addr1> <addr2>>
  Disassemble memory locations between addr1 and addr2.
elf file
  Load elf file into simulated memory.
hex file
  Load hex file into simulated memory.
replay_file file
  Open command file for replay.
replay n
  Execute the next n commands in the replay file or all the
  remaining commands if n is missing.
replay step n
  Execute consecutive commands from the replay file until n
  step commands are executed or the file is exhausted
reset [<reset_pc>]
  Reset hart.  If reset_pc is given, then change the reset program
  counter to the given reset_pc before resetting the hart.
symbols
  List all the symbols in the loaded ELF file(s).
pagetable
  Print the entries of the address tanslation table.
exception inst [<offset>]
  Take an instruction access fault on the subsequent step command. Given
  offset (defaults to zero) is added to the instruction PC to form the address
  responsible for the fault (that address is placed in the mtval CSR).
exception data [<offset>]
  Take a data access fault on the subsequent load/store instruction executed
  by a step command. The offset value is currently not used.
quit
  Terminate the simulator
